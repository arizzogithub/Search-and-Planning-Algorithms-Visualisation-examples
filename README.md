Search and Planning.

Transport for London helpfully provides visitors with a map that shows walking times between stations on the London Underground: see http://content.tfl.gov.uk/walking-tube-map.pdf. Suppose you are doing research for a book on the architecture of Underground stations, and your task for today is to walk between Victoria Station and Leicester Square, making sure you walk past each intermediate station on your route (no short cuts).
Tasks:
1. Write a problem formulation for this activity including precise descriptions of the initial state, the actions available at each state, a goal test and a path cost function. Please note, you are only required to specify the actions available at stations that feature in the search trees you construct in your answers to (b) below.

2. Show how the quickest route will be calculated by each of the following search strategies:
i. Breadth-first search.
ii. Depth-limited search, to a depth limit determined by you (give reasons for your decision).
iii. Uniform-cost search.

3. Now find the fastest walking time from each relevant station to Leicester Square using https://walkit.com/.
